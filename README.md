<h2> Auto Strafing CS:GO 2</h2>

This project consists of Python scripts designed to enhance Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) gameplay by automating counter-strafing movements. The scripts use the Pynput library to simulate keyboard and mouse inputs, providing a more efficient way to perform counter-strafing manoeuvres in CS:GO 2

**Features**

- Automated Counter-Strafing: Automatically performs counter-movements when specific keys are pressed, aiding in maintaining accuracy while moving.
- Customizable Key Mappings: Easily configure key mappings for personalized gameplay.
- Jump Detection: Detects mouse scroll inputs (used for jumping in CS:GO) to adjust movements accordingly.
- Delayed Clicks: Simulates delayed mouse clicks, providing more control over firing.
- Exit and Toggle Controls: Includes keyboard controls to exit the script or toggle its functionality during gameplay.
- Installation
- To use these scripts, you must have Python installed on your computer and the pynput and pyautogui libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

**BASH**
"pip install pynput pyautogui"


**Usage**

- Start CS:GO on your computer.
- Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's directory, and run the script using Python.
- bash
- Copy code
- python <script_name>.py

**In-Game Controls:**

- Press '.' to stop and exit the script.
- Press '+' to enable or disable the script's functionalities.
- Use the mouse scroll wheel to jump (the script detects this to adjust movements).

**Scripts Overview**

- Main Counter-Strafing Script: Automates counter-movements based on the player's current movement keys.
- Mouse Click Delay Script: Delays mouse clicks for controlled firing. #Does not currently work#
- Alternate Strafing Script: A variation of the main script with different timings and behaviours.

**Disclaimer**
This script is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the automation capabilities of Python. Please be aware of the game's terms of service regarding using scripts and automation tools.
